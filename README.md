# NMR
To compile this program, type "make" in the console. Then type "./main" in the console to run it. 

Upon the end of the program, the user is prompted to view whatever file was entered in as the
output file name to see the analysis and results of the NMR process.

In the default case it is "analysis.txt". To view the output file type "cat" and then whatever the
output file name is. 

In the nmr.in file is where all of the input lives. To change the value of any of the input fields, edit
nmr.in.
